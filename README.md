## My Self Assessment: 
Completing the Computer Science program has helped me grow both technically and professionally. Through my coursework and the process of building my ePortfolio, I’ve learned how to design, develop and manage software that solves real world problems. The capstone project brought together everything I’ve learned. Software design, databases, algorithms and security into one complete example of my skills. This experience helped me better understand my strengths and prepare for a career in computer science.
Throughout the program, I gained valuable experience about what it’s like working in teams and communicating with others. Workflow projects taught me how to share ideas and how I’d explain technical concepts to people with different backgrounds. I’ve learned that good communication and teamwork are just as important as technical ability when it comes to creating successful software.
My studies in data structures and algorithms strengthened my problem solving and programming skills. I can now choose the right structures and write more efficient code. In software engineering and database courses, I learned the full process of software development from planning and design to testing and maintenance. The updated version of my Pet Check-In project, which uses SQLite to store data, shows my ability to build functional and reliable systems. I also learned about security practices, such as input validation and data protection, which are very important for creating safe applications.
The ePortfolio showcases my growth and the skills I’ve developed across the program. Each artifact represents a key area, software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures and databases, and together they demonstrate my ability to design, code and manage complete software solutions.
Overall, this program has prepared me to enter the computer science field with confidence. I’ve learned how to think critically, solve problems and work effectively with others. Moving forward, I plan to continue improving my skills and applying them to meaningful and innovative tech projects.
